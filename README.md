# Celebrate for Change

Celebrate for Change is a student-built social impact platform that redirects
the generosity of personal celebrations—such as birthdays—toward verified
nonprofit organizations through direct, transparent donation links.

The project explores how individual milestones can be reframed as economic
and behavioral incentives for positive social impact.

## Why This Project Exists

Many charitable platforms introduce intermediaries that reduce transparency
and distance donors from impact. Celebrate for Change was built to demonstrate
a simpler model: users are routed directly to official nonprofit donation pages,
ensuring clarity, trust, and ethical design.

This project was created as part of an independent exploration of economics,
incentives, and social impact through technology.
